# ContentSyncTestRepo
Dummy repo for testing ContentSync functionality


the layout of the repo doesnt matter. what matters is the json file is setup correctly and the URL paths to the zip files are DIRECT LINKS


ContentSync will use the Name and URL given for an entry, Look for a json file like this repo's index.json and find the entry with the same Name.
These zips are not real datapacks/resourcepacks/script zips. just dummy files so i can test.



Example ContentSync config.json that is used against this repo.
Proper docs will be availible on ContentSync's repo once it is ready.

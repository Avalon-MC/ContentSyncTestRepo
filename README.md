# ContentSyncTestRepo
Dummy repo for testing ContentSync functionality

NEW EXAMPES ARE BEING CREATED CURRENTLY. These will replace the current dummy examples with a real block and item.


the layout of the repo doesnt matter, what matters is:
* the json file is setup correctly
* the URL paths to the zip files are DIRECT LINKS
* the datapack and resourcepack zips ARE VALID PACKS
* the KubeJS zips contain a 'client_scripts', 'server_scripts' and/or 'startup_scripts' folder (all 3 or only 1 is valid, none is not)
